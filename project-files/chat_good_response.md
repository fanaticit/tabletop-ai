# Question
How do the cats craft cards?

# Response

The cats (Marquise de Cat) craft using workshops.

During Daylight, before taking their normal actions, the Marquise may activate workshops to craft cards from their hand. Each workshop is a crafting piece, and its suit matches the suit of the clearing it’s in. If the card you want to craft shows, for example, two mouse symbols, you’d need to activate two mouse workshops that turn to meet the cost.

Immediate effect cards (paper box) give a one-time bonus, then get discarded. If it shows an item, you take the matching item from the supply and place it in your Crafted Items box, scoring the listed victory points.

Persistent effect cards (stone box) stay in play in front of you, giving an ongoing ability. You can’t craft the same persistent effect twice.

So in short: Cats craft by activating their workshops during Daylight, and each workshop can be used only once per turn.

Would you like me to also explain how this compares to how the birds, mice, and raccoon craft? It highlights how different their economies feel.
